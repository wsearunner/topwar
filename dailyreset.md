# Pre-reset
- do not build barracks, shipyards, etc or train units
- leave some radar, VIT unless you will be leveling up
- turn off auto-join
- collect dimension mines, rewards, are fine

# Daily Reset
1. Reward Quest

   - look at promotion badge to see what quest level (usually rare -> elite -> epic)
   - reset any lower quests (blue) to higher ... use gems if you like
     - you can reset any that were completed
     - you can reset any you don't want to complete
     - I don't reset elite even if I would level up rank

2. Expedition Base

   - clear truck
   - rush & collect

3. Craft Center

   - High-rate fire - craft
   - Alliance Help for any needed gems (alliance help is great post-refresh as many people are online)

4. Hunting Guild - make sure you're caught up

5. Alliance donations - tech, ruins, buildings

6. Do all radar missions - you can leave yellow missions for later in the day (they are 24h)

7. Get all alliance gifts

   - Item Store - buy max gold for gems
   - VIP Store - claim weekly gifts (lvl 3 CPNT chests, orange shards)

9. any red dots

   - claim as needed

10. Gathering

   - return any gathers to collect Reward Quest
   - send back out gathering based on research needs - R&D, oil, farms (never gather gold)

11. Dark Forces / Warhammer

   - send strongest march for any Empire Relics (I just use Di / Rob as my main march)
   - once Radar is exhausted, send out 5x DF or WH rally
     - DF based on what research is needed to level up - usually unit research is best
   - reset to strongest march with Di / Rob (formation #1)

12. Base / Research / Level Up

    - claim 3x free gold
    - try to merge gold mines - get to highest level
    - merge units / base buildings (make sure to claim new units researched on merge)
    - start any new unit builds (Army > Navy > AF)
    - Radar HQ - any research upgrades (top to bottom)
      - gold from 3x free, gem exchange, harvester, boxes - usually save boxes as much as possible
      - Sandtable to push whatever tech you need for upgrades
    - Special Effect Research (lvl 56) - upgrade all available

13. Complete any Quest Rewards - speed up, train units, etc
    - might inform WH vs DF battles
    - train units - use speed up on those closest to complete
    
14. usually once everything is exhausted, do component upgrades, hero upgrades, decor, etc
    - I do Expedition Mines later in the day
    - Warzone, Expedition, Island usually after all leveled up & stronger overall

15. reset auto-update and relax
